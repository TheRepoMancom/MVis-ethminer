[Node]

; IP and RPC port of your primary node.  Defaults to 127.0.0.1 and 8545
Host=127.0.0.1
;Host=https://mainnet.infura.io/your_api_key
RPCPort=8545

[0xBitcoin]

; Your ETH account and private key.  Note the acct starts with 0x, but
; not the PK.  Mining rewards will be deposited to this account.  Transaction
; fees will be DRAWN from this account.  Make sure you have enough funds!!
; If you have multiple mining rigs, make sure each rig is running under a 
; separate ETH account, to prevent nonce collisions if they happen to submit
; txs at nearly the same time.
MinerAcct=0x........................................
AcctPK=................................................................

; 0xBitcoin contract address. normally you will not change this.
TokenContract=0xb6ed7644c69416d67b522e20bc294a9a9b405b31

; when your miner finds a solution, transactions will be submitted with this 
; amount of gas (gwei).  You can change this setting 'on the fly' (without having
; to restart the miner).  All other setting changes require the miner to be restarted.
GasPrice=5

; Set to 1 to enable gas price bidding.  Transactions will be submitted
; with [GasPrice] gas, unless there is someone else bidding, in which case
; the gas price will be set to the price of the competing bid + [BidTop], up
; to a maximum of [MaxGasPrice]. This feature has only been tested when running
; Geth as a local node.  It is NOT supported by Infura nodes.
GasPriceBidding=0

; max gas price you're willing to bid up to
MaxGasPrice=35

; the # of gwei to top the highest bidder
BidTop=2

; if you have multiple mining rigs, specify a shared folder to make sure
; multiple miners don't try to submit a solution for the same challenge.
; eg. ChallengeFolder=\\DESKTOP\folder_name
ChallengeFolder=

[ThermalProtection]

; Temperature provider ('amd_adl' or 'speedfan')
TempProvider=amd_adl

; Default temperature at which GPU throttling is activated. This applies to all GPUs on this mining rig.
; Note: throttling is at the hashing level, not the driver level.
ThrottleTemp=80

; Number of seconds after which the entire mining rig will shutdown if one or more GPUs
; remain at or above ThrottleTemp.
ShutDown=20
